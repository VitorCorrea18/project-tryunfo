## Obervations
  The project could not be completed 100% in the time i had, as there were much more to study and projects to be carried out,
  so some features were never implemented. With time maybe i can go back to review this and add all the feats i had in mind but for now I'll leave a list with
  the features that were not implemented:
  
  - Filter by <strong>Rarity</strong> <br>
  - Filter by <strong>Super Trunfo</strong>
